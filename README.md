# Introducing Elm: the language and architecture for web development

This repository contains the material for the 22nd of March [elm cambridge meetup](https://www.meetup.com/elm-cambridge/events/248132273/).

* [*Introduction.md*](https://github.com/deciob/introducing-elm-with-world-bank-example/blob/master/Introduction.md) is a brief overview of the Elm programming language.

* *Main.elm* is a variation of the [elm http example](http://elm-lang.org/examples/http) from the elm website. It makes some random requests to the World Bank public data api.

* [*MainTODO.elm*](https://github.com/deciob/introducing-elm-with-world-bank-example/blob/master/MainTODO.elm) is just a sckeleton of Main.elm that compiles, but does nothing. This can be the starting point to get your hands dirty on elm. This is just a suggestion, a starting point and you do not need to follow what's in *Main.elm*.


You can either clone this repository, install elm on your laptop with npm and then run MainTODO.elm with elm-reactor or alternatively you can use [Ellie](https://ellie-app.com/new).

For more information about the World Bank open data API have a look at the links in [*resourses.md*](https://github.com/deciob/introducing-elm-with-world-bank-example/blob/master/resourses.md).
